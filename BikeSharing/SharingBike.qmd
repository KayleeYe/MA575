## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
datasetBike <- read.csv('/Users/yeyibo/Downloads/bike+sharing+dataset/day.csv')
head(datasetBike)
```

```{r}
#the mean counts of bike shared per day
mean_cnt <- mean(datasetBike$cnt, na.rm = TRUE)
print(paste("Mean:", mean_cnt))
```

```{r}
#the mmode counts of bike shared per day
get_mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}

# the mode price
mode_cnt <- get_mode(datasetBike$cnt)
print(paste("Mode:", mode_cnt))
```

```{r}

```
